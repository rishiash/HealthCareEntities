## General Information
- Goal is to build a custom NER to get the list of diseases and their treatment from the dataset.
- Dataset provided is in the form of one word per line.
- Pre-processed the data to recover the complete sentences and their labels.
- Predicted the labels of each of the tokens in each sentence of the test dataset that has been pre processed.
- Created the logic to get all the predicted treatments (T) labels corresponding to each disease (D) label in the test dataset.

## Conclusions
- Here is a sample table created by the code.
- Disease :					                        Treatment
- hereditary retinoblastoma :		            radiotherapy
- treating stress urinary incontinence :    surgical procedures
- malignant pleural mesothelioma :		      radiotherapy and chemotherapy
- ...	:				...
